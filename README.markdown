# Rachel's dotfiles

## About

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and use vim. These include some helpful shortcuts and settings I've become accustomed to. Please feel free to use/copy/steal whatever you see here because I've done the same in order to find the perfect fit for myself.

## Install

    curl https://raw.github.com/rachelober/dotfiles/master/tools/install.sh | sh

## Shell dotfiles

This doesn't include any dotfiles for shells. Therefore it integrates well with zsh/tcsh/bash. Personally, I use [my own fork of oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/rachelober/oh-my-zsh) and therefore run this command after bootstrapping.

    curl https://raw.github.com/rachelober/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh

## Vim

I got lazy and now mostly use [Janus by carlhuda](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) with additional tweaks via my .gvimrc.after and .vimrc.after which are now included in my dotfiles. I removed all of my old .vim configurations.
