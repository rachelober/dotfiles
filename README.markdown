# Rachel's dotfiles

## About

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and use vim. These include some helpful shortcuts and settings I've become accustomed to. Please feel free to use/copy/steal whatever you see here because I've done the same in order to find the perfect fit for myself.

## Install

    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/rachelober/dotfiles/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh

## Shell dotfiles

This doesn't include any dotfiles for shells. Therefore it integrates well with zsh/tcsh/bash. Personally, I use [my own fork of oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/rachelober/oh-my-zsh) and therefore run this command after bootstrapping.

    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/rachelober/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh
